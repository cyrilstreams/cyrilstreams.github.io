      <td>After having been missing for nearly 20 years,
      <br>Rick Sanchez suddenly arrives at daughter Beth's 
      <br>doorstep to move in with her and her family. 
      <br>Although Beth welcomes Rick into her home, her
      <br>husband, Jerry, isn't as happy about the family
      <br>reunion. Jerry is concerned about Rick, a 
      <br>sociopathic scientist, using the garage as his
      <br>personal laboratory. In the lab, Rick works on 
      <br>a number of sci-fi gadgets, some of which could 
      <br>be considered dangerous. But that's not all Rick 
      <br>does that concerns Jerry. He also goes on 
      <br>adventures across the universe that often involve
      <br>his grandchildren, Morty and Summer.</td>
