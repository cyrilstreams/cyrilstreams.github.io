  <table>

      <td><img src="/icons/trig.jpg" alt="Season 1" width="182" height="268"></td>
      <td>Trigun revolves around a man known as 
      <br>"Vash the Stampede" and two Bernardelli 
      <br>Insurance Society employees, Meryl Stryfe 
      <br>and Milly Thompson, who follow him around 
      <br>in order to minimize the damages inevitably 
      <br>caused by his appearance. Most of the damage 
      <br>attributed to Vash is actually caused by 
      <br>bounty hunters in pursuit of the sixty 
      <br>billion double dollar bounty on Vash's
      <br>head for the destruction of the city of July.
